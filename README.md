# Stefano Vertua | Business Analyst


**About Me**  

Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile! <br>
My portfolio includes projects involving Excel, SQL, and Power BI, all designed to solve complex problems with data-driven approaches.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid traveler (40+ countries visited). I also have a strong interest in Geography, Architecture, Urban Planning, Books, Vexillology (flags!), and Politics.  <br>

Numbers and data are my tools, and I'm always looking for new ways to apply them creatively and effectively.
