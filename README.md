# Stefano Vertua | Business Intelligence & Business IT Analyst


## **About Me**  

Hi there, welcome to my GitHub profile!

I’m a motivated professional with a strong foundation in business intelligence and data analysis, with 3+ years of experience across business analytics and IT operations, focused on improving performance through data-driven reporting and process optimization. In my previous roles, I developed BI dashboards for 50+ clients, contributing to an average of 15% improvement in conversion rates. <br>
I’m passionate about applying creative and effective solutions to real-world problems, helping businesses unlock the power of their data. Numbers and data are my tools, and I’m always looking for new ways to apply them. <br>

My portfolio is built around actual business questions and end-to-end workflows, using tools like Excel (Power Query), SQL, Power BI (DAX), and Looker Studio. <br>

Outside of work, I’m an avid traveler (40+ countries visited). I’m also interested in geography, architecture, urban planning, books, vexillology (flags!), and politics. <br>

My favorite quote is: "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."
